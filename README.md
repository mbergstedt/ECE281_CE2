####Structural Design

My screenshot matched the image from the instructions.  Each output was on in only one case.  All outputs needed the EN
input to be on.  For Y0, I0 and I1 needed to be off.  For Y1, I0 needed to be on and I1 needed to be off.  For Y2, I0
needed to be off and I1 needed to be on.  For Y3, all inputs needed to be on.
####Behavioral Design

My behavioral screenshot matched the other screenshots and had the same results.
